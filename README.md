# State-tracker
State machine class for own (Arduino) projects

The idea is to have a less complicated State Machine tool than Automaton.
However I respect that, I do not need pre-configured machines, but I need more univeral machine that controls my projects in async run.

This may not be standard as I implement "back to previous state" and "force state" functions.
State Machine "world" may not like it, but I often need those without a sophisticated modell.
